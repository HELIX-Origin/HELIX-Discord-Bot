# 🤖 Reddit Feeds & Pure Image Mode

HELIX Discord Bot offers a dedicated Reddit engine optimized for subreddit syndication, visual media extraction, and formatting. It supports both **Pure Image Mode** and **Standard RSS Mode**.

---

## 🎨 Pure Image Mode vs. Standard RSS Mode

Reddit feeds can be configured in one of two display modes:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 1. Pure Image Mode (feedType: 'reddit')                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Ideal for: r/wallpapers, r/memes, r/aww, r/Art, r/earthporn │
│ Behavior:                                                   │
│ • Strips out lengthy markdown text and submission boilerplate│
│ • Extracts full-resolution image/gallery/gifv media        │
│ • Displays the title and high-resolution banner image       │
│ • Compact footer with subreddit link & author               │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 2. Standard RSS Mode (feedType: 'rss')                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Ideal for: r/technology, r/AskReddit, r/worldnews, r/gaming │
│ Behavior:                                                   │
│ • Preserves textual self-post content & excerpt preview     │
│ • Displays rich thumbnail card and discussion thread stats  │
│ • Full article embed formatting                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🖼️ Media Extraction & GIF Handling

Reddit media syndication handles multiple media hosts and formats:
1. **Reddit Image Hosting (`i.redd.it`)**: Resolves original uncompressed resolution.
2. **Reddit Galleries (`reddit.com/gallery/...`)**: Automatically extracts the primary high-res slide.
3. **Imgur & Gfycat**: Resolves static previews and animated GIF equivalents (`.gifv` -> `.gif`).
4. **Reddit Video Previews (`v.redd.it`)**: Extracts the high-definition poster image and direct video preview URL.
5. **Thumbnails Fallback**: If an image is missing or blocked, the engine attempts to fall back to the Reddit preview thumbnail.

## 🔍 Subreddit Sorting & Filters

When subscribing to a subreddit, you can specify sort orders and filters:

| Syntax Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `r/technology` | Default hot posts feed |
| `r/wallpapers/top?t=day` | Top posts of the current day |
| `r/memes/top?t=week` | Top posts of the week |
| `r/news/new` | Real-time newest submissions |
| `r/aww+cats` | Multi-subreddit combination feed |

## 🔄 Toggling Feed Mode

You can toggle an existing Reddit feed between **Pure Image Mode** and **Standard RSS Mode** at any time without recreating the subscription.

### Via Web Dashboard
1. Navigate to the **Reddit Feeds** tab.
2. Locate the feed card.
3. Use the **Mode Switcher** toggle (`Pure Image` vs `RSS Article`).
4. Changes take effect on the next polling cycle.

### Via REST API
```http
PATCH /api/feeds/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "feedType": "reddit"
}
```
*(Set `"feedType": "rss"` to switch back to Standard RSS Mode).*

## 🛡️ Preventing Reddit Rate Limiting (429 Errors)

Reddit enforces rate limits on RSS and XML queries based on the HTTP `User-Agent`.

### Best Practices:
1. Set a unique, descriptive User-Agent in `.env` (`USER_AGENT`):
   ```env
   USER_AGENT="HelixRSS/0.1.0 (by /u/YourRedditUsername; contact: admin@yourdomain.com)"
   ```
2. Avoid short delivery intervals for high-volume Reddit subscriptions — use the dashboard's 10–60 minute posting options.
3. If you run multiple subreddits, combine them using the multi-reddit format (e.g., `r/tech+gadgets+hardware`) rather than 3 separate feeds.

## 🔐 Reddit Session Cookies (Required)

Reddit no longer supplies a public API key for developers and blocks unauthenticated `about.json` probes (HTTP 403). To read each subreddit's content rating and keep Reddit feeds working, HELIX needs a **logged-in Reddit session cookie file**.

### Setup
1. Export your Reddit session cookies to a **`cookies.json`** file (preferred format, e.g. with the **"Get Cookies Locally"** browser extension while logged in to reddit.com) — or a Netscape-format **`cookies.txt`** file.
2. Place the file **at the repo root** (next to `.env`), or point to it explicitly:
   ```env
   REDDIT_COOKIES_FILE=/absolute/path/to/cookies.json
   ```
3. Restart the bot.

Resolution order: `REDDIT_COOKIES_FILE` → `cookies.json` (preferred) → `cookies.txt` (fallback).

> ⚠️ **Security**: always use a dedicated **alt Reddit account** for this cookie file to avoid possible account bans on your primary account. The files are gitignored — never commit them.

### Feature Gating
Without a cookie file the **Reddit tab in the dashboard and the `/reddit` commands are disabled**. The command returns a `Reddit Feeds Disabled` notice and the dashboard tab shows a banner explaining how to enable Reddit feeds.

## 🛡️ Age-Restriction (NSFW) Enforcement

HELIX verifies each subreddit's rating via the authenticated `about.json` endpoint (`data.over18`) and enforces Discord's age-restriction flag:

| Subreddit rating | Allowed delivery targets |
| :--- | :--- |
| Verified **SFW** | Any text channel or announcement channel |
| **NSFW** (`over18: true`) | Only **age-restricted (NSFW)** Discord channels |
| **Unverifiable** (probe failed / no session) | Denied for normal channels — only age-restricted targets (fails closed) |

- A feed thread inherits the age-restriction state of its parent **channel** (threads are auto-created inside the feed's configured text channel).
- If the selected channel is not age-restricted, adding or moving an NSFW/unverifiable subreddit is rejected with a clear error message both in the dashboard and via `/reddit add`.
- This keeps NSFW content locked to channels explicitly marked as **NSFW** in Discord's age-restricted channel settings.
