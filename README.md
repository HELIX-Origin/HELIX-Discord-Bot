## 📖 Overview

**HELIX Discord Bot** is a lightweight, multi-user feed syndication engine and Discord bot built natively in TypeScript ESM. It automatically monitors RSS/Atom feeds, custom CSS webpage scrapers, curated subreddit streams, and weekly 100% OFF free game promotions—delivering clean, rich Discord embeds straight to your server channels without any webhook management overhead.

Featuring a built-in web dashboard, Discord OAuth2 authentication, zero frontend npm dependencies, SQLite persistent storage, and optional Redis clustering, HELIX Discord Bot provides everything you need to keep your Discord community informed in real time.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎮 Free Games Giveaway Alerts
- **Multi-Platform Support**: Official support for **Epic Games Store**, **Steam**, **GOG.com**, **IndieGala**, **Humble Bundle**, **Itch.io**, **Ubisoft Store**, **EA App / Origin**, **Prime Gaming**, and **Battle.net**.
- **Automated Monday Drops**: Runs on an automated weekly schedule (every Monday) with an instant manual polling trigger in the dashboard.
- **Rich Store Embeds**: Standardized Discord embeds with official store branding, high-contrast badges, pricing worth, expiration timers, and direct claim links.

### 🤖 Custom Reddit Feeds
- **Subreddit & User Feeds**: Subscribe to any subreddit (e.g. `r/technology`, `r/wallpapers`, `r/EarthPorn`), user stream, or custom `.rss` URL.
- **Dual Display Modes**:
  - 🖼️ **Pure Image Mode**: Extracts full-resolution images and animated GIFs while stripping out message text bodies.
  - 📰 **Standard RSS Mode**: Formats complete message prose, author badges, and dedicated discussion link fields.
- **Animated GIF Prioritization**: Automatically resolves and displays direct `.gif` animations and Imgur `.gifv` media.
- **Interactive Mode Switcher**: Toggle any active Reddit feed between Image and RSS mode in one click.

### 📰 Curated News Feeds Catalog
- **700+ Verified Presets**: One-click subscription to top publications across Technology, Artificial Intelligence, Gaming, Science, Cybersecurity, Hardware, Apple, Linux, Programming, Finance, and Entertainment.
- **Organized Categories**: Clean category grouping with automated Discord channel routing.

### 🕷️ Custom CSS Webpage Scraper
- **Scrape Any Site Without RSS**: Turn any website, blog, or forum into an automated Discord feed using standard CSS selectors (`itemSelector`, `titleSelector`, `linkSelector`, `descriptionSelector`).
- **Relative URL Resolution**: Automatically expands relative links (`/posts/123`) to full canonical HTTP addresses.

### 🎨 Uniform Standardized Embeds
- **Single Shared Width**: Uniform card layout across all feeds and platforms.
- **Structured Fields**: Links, source attribution, and metadata are cleanly placed in dedicated embed fields rather than cluttered inline text.

### 🤖 Discord Bot Integration
- **Direct Channel Delivery**: Delivers directly to text channels via the Discord REST API—no webhook creation or management required.
- **Forum Thread Delivery** *(optional, per server)*: Each feed can deliver into its own dedicated thread inside a forum channel—threads are kept open via keepalive polling and rotate into a fresh thread when they grow large. Configured from the dashboard Feeds tab or `FORUM_CHANNEL_IDS` env.
- **Slash Commands**: Interactive commands (`/feed`, `/stats`, `/about`, `/help`) for checking feed statuses directly in Discord.
- **Automatic Owner Detection**: Automatically grants full Owner rights to Discord Application owners and team members upon Discord login.
