## ⏰ Polling Schedule & Delivery Mechanism

### 1. Daily Automated Polling
Free game giveaways are often time-limited, so HELIX Discord Bot polls active `freegames` feeds **daily** instead of only once a week.
- The background feed watcher inspects active `freegames` feeds on a daily schedule.
- Only genuinely new giveaways are announced; duplicates are suppressed by the composite deduplication engine.

## 🎨 Embed Appearance & Metadata Extraction

Each free game notification is formatted as a rich Discord embed:
- **Title**: Game Name + Original Worth / Discount (e.g., `🎮 DEATH STRANDING (Free - 100% off, was $39.99)`).
- **Author Tag**: Storefront Name + Storefront Logo Icon (e.g., `Epic Games Store` with official Epic Games icon).
- **Description**: Game synopsis and expiration countdown / claiming deadline.
- **Fields**:
  - `Platforms`: Windows, Mac, Linux, Steam Deck compatibility.
  - `Original Price`: Formatted currency (e.g., `$29.99 USD`).
  - `Giveaway Type`: 100% Free to Keep / DRM-Free / Key Giveaway.
  - `Store URL`: Direct store redemption button link.
- **Banner Image**: High-resolution store key art / promo banner.
- **Embed Color**: Matches storefront color theme (e.g., `#0078F2` for Epic, `#171A21` for Steam, `#9B51E0` for GOG).
