# 🤖 Discord Bot & Commands

HELIX Discord Bot operates as a Discord application using a **native connection** — a Gateway WebSocket for live events (`src/bot/gateway.ts`) and the Discord REST API for interactions and messages (`src/bot/rest.ts`). No `discord.js` dependency is required. It delivers notifications directly to channels, eliminating the need to manage external webhooks.

## ⚡ Slash Commands Reference

All commands register through Discord's native interaction model and use ephemeral response flags where appropriate (e.g. errors), with owner/team detection for elevated bot features.

| Command | Subcommands / Options | Permissions Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/feed add` | `url: <string>`, `channel: <channel>`, `role: <role?>`, `color: <hex?>` | `Manage Channels` or `Administrator` | Adds a new feed subscription to a channel. |
| `/feed list` | `channel: <channel?>` | `Manage Channels` or `Administrator` | Displays all active feed subscriptions on the server. |
| `/feed remove` | `id: <feed_id>` | `Manage Channels` or `Administrator` | Removes an existing feed subscription by ID. |
| `/stats` | *None* | Everyone | Displays bot uptime, memory usage, and delivery analytics. |
| `/about` | *None* | Everyone | Shows version info, repository links, and developer credits. |
| `/help` | `topic: <string?>` | Everyone | Interactive documentation browser with command usage tips. |

## 🔒 Required Discord Bot Permissions

When inviting the bot to your Discord server, ensure it is granted the following permissions in target channels:

| Permission Name | Flag | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **View Channel** | `ViewChannel` | Discover channel and read status |
| **Send Messages** | `SendMessages` | Post text notifications and role mentions |
| **Embed Links** | `EmbedLinks` | Render rich embed cards with thumbnails and links |
| **Attach Files** | `AttachFiles` | Upload images/banners when remote hotlinking is blocked |
| **Mention Everyone / Roles** | `MentionEveryone` | Ping configured notification roles (`@role`) |
| **Use External Emojis** | `UseExternalEmojis` | Display custom source platform icons |
| **Send Messages in Threads** | `SendMessagesInThreads` | Post feed entries inside feed threads |
| **Create Public Threads** | `CreatePublicThreads` | Open per-feed threads inside forum channels |
| **Manage Threads** | `ManageThreads` | Archive/rotate large feed threads, keepalive polling |

> The invite URLs rendered across the dashboard include these thread bits on top of the base permission set.

## 🧵 Forum Thread Delivery (Optional)

Instead of delivering into a regular channel, a server can opt each feed subscription into **its own dedicated thread inside a forum channel** (one thread per feed, named after the feed). The feature is entirely optional and **per server**:

- Enabled from the dashboard **Feeds tab** (per-server "Forum Thread Delivery" card — any guild manager can configure it) or via the global `FORUM_CHANNEL_IDS` env default.
- The first feed entry becomes the thread's **opening post**; subsequent entries land as messages inside the same thread.
- Threads are **kept open** by a keepalive pass that posts a tiny message whenever a thread is within ~24h of Discord's auto-archive. (Disabled with `THREAD_KEEPALIVE_ENABLED=false`.)
- When a thread reaches `THREAD_MAX_MESSAGES` (default `100`) entries, the large thread is **archived + locked** and a **fresh thread** opens automatically in its place.
- Servers without thread delivery enabled behave exactly as before (direct channel delivery).

See [Configuration → Forum Thread Delivery](Configuration.md) for the full variable reference.

## 🎨 Rich Embed Formatting & Customization

Notifications are styled using Discord rich embeds:

```

- **Custom Colors**: Each feed can specify a unique hex color (e.g. `#f59e0b` for RSS feeds, `#FF4500` for Reddit, `#0078F2` for Epic Games).
- **Author Branding**: Source platforms and storefronts display their high-resolution official branding icons.
- **Smart Truncation**: Descriptions exceeding Discord embed character limits (4,096 chars for description, 256 for title) are cleanly truncated at word boundaries with ellipsis (`...`).
- **Role Mentions**: Configured role mentions are prepended to the message payload, triggering push notifications for subscribed server members.
